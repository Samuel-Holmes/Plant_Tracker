# Plant_Tracker

This project has been created due to my personal passion for indoor plants. I have tried using various Android apps to track watering habits and plant health, however, there is eventually paywalls hit. To overcome this I decided to have a go making a personal tracker. This would provide a more tailored experience whilst also allowing me to learn some new technologies at the same time. It removes the limitation of features without payment, provided I can implement them myself that is.
