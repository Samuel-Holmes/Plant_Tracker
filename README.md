# Plant Tracker

This project was created due to my personal passion for indoor plants. I have tried using various Android apps to track watering habits and plant health; however, I eventually hit paywalls. To overcome this, I decided to create a personal tracker. This would provide a more tailored experience while also allowing me to learn some new technologies at the same time. It removes the limitation of features behind a paywallâ€”provided I can implement them myself, that is.

### Project Objectives:

* Create a web app with database storage using authentication to allow individual users based on their credentials.
